# Automated-Deployment-Pipeline
## CI/CD Pipeline with SonarQube, Docker, k8s, GitHub Webhooks and Grafana on AWS.
### Overview
This project implements a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins on AWS, integrating essential tools such as SonarQube, Docker, k8s and GitHub Webhooks, and grafana for monitoring . The goal is to automate the software development lifecycle, ensuring efficient and consistent delivery of high-quality code and automated pipeline. The pipeline encompasses continuous integration, automated testing, code analysis with SonarQube, Docker containerization, and seamless deployment on AWS.
## Key Components
# Jenkins Server on AWS:
Hosts the CI/CD pipeline. Manages build and deployment stages. Utilizes Jenkins plugins for integration with AWS services.
# SonarQube:
Conducts static code analysis to identify and rectify code quality issues. Integrates seamlessly into the pipeline to enforce coding standards and best practices.
# Docker:
Employs containerization to ensure consistency across different environments. Builds Docker images as part of the CI/CD process for application deployment.
# GitHub Webhooks:
Enables automatic triggering of the Jenkins pipeline upon code commits or pull requests. Enhances automation and reduces manual intervention.
# Kubernetes:
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.
# Grafana:
Grafana is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application. It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources.
# AWS Services:
AWS resources such as EC2 instances and S3 buckets are leveraged for Jenkins and artifact storage. IAM roles and policies are defined for secure access and permissions.
# Workflow:
Code Commit and GitHub Webhook: Developers push code changes to the GitHub repository. GitHub Webhooks trigger the Jenkins pipeline on code events.

### Continuous Integration (CI):

Jenkins initiates the CI process, pulling the latest code. Executes automated build and test scripts to ensure code reliability. Static Code Analysis with SonarQube:

SonarQube assesses code quality, identifying issues and vulnerabilities. Jenkins integrates SonarQube reports into the pipeline. Docker Containerization:

The application is containerized using Docker for consistent deployment.

### Continuous Deployment (CD) on AWS:

Jenkins orchestrates the deployment process on AWS. Utilizes AWS resources to deploy the Docker containers and the application. Monitoring and Notifications:

Jenkins provides detailed logs and notifications for the CI/CD pipeline. Integration with monitoring tools for tracking performance and issues.

## Benefits:
Efficiency and Consistency: Automation reduces manual errors and ensures consistent deployments.

Code Quality Assurance: SonarQube enforces code quality standards, fostering maintainability.

Scalability: AWS resources enable scalable infrastructure based on application needs.

Rapid Iterations: Streamlined CI/CD accelerates development cycles, allowing for faster iterations. This Jenkins CI/CD pipeline project on AWS optimizes the software delivery process, fostering collaboration, and ensuring the reliability and quality of deployed applications.
